If Login system is not working in your system, then please go on category or books tab present in the header bar.

To run the project please use     localhost:8080 in your browser.

After that please click on Categories or Books or Publishers to see the details.

Also you can edit the values of all these And able to add new values.

Here I use H2Database which is integrated/embedded in spring, so that without any trouble you can run the Project.
